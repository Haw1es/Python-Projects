### Resolves issues if file not found
try:
    fhand = open(fname)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: File '{fname}' not found.")

### Splits the line into words and adds them to the counts dictionary
for line in fhand:
    words = line.split()
    for word in words:
        counts[word] = counts.get(word, 0 ) + 1

### Creates list of words as word:count
lst = list()
for key, value in counts.items():
    newtup = (value, key)
    lst.append(newtup)

##Reverses list and displays top 10
lst = sorted(lst, reverse=True)
for value, key in lst[:10]:
    print(key, value)
